                            <b>Abstract</b><br>
                            In first-person shooter (FPS) games, crosshair design plays a pivotal role in aiming accuracy
                            and overall performance. This study examines how different crosshair colours affect player’s
                            accuracy in VALORANT, aiming to identify the optimal colour choice that enhances accuracy
                            while aiming.
                            <br><br>
                            For this study, I asked 27 participants to complete a series of standardised tasks, using four
                            distinct crosshair colours; white, green, yellow, and red. Each colour crosshair was used
                            three times, and accuracy was recorded, along with an average accuracy. A within-subject
                            analysis was conducted, comparing each participant’s average accuracy with each crosshair
                            colour against their overall average performance. This data was then also sorted into
                            participant skill level, allowing for a deeper analysis.
                            <br><br>
                            Quantitative analysis showed that participants using the green crosshair demonstrated a
                            statistically significant improvement in accuracy compared to other colors (p < 0.05).
                            Conversely, the yellow crosshair resulted in the poorest performance across all skill levels,
                            likely due to its lack of contrast against the in-game environment. Red and white crosshairs
                            showed mixed results, with red slightly outperforming white at mid-skill levels but showing no
                            significant advantage overall. Qualitative survey responses supported these findings, with
                            participants rating green as the easiest to see and yellow as the most distracting. Visibility
                            and player preference were closely aligned with performance metrics, further reinforcing the
                            importance of contrast and visibility in crosshair design.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Introduction</b><br>
                            The field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) seeks to enhance the user experience
                            through an understanding of how individuals interact with digital systems. Within the context
                            of first-person shooter (FPS) games, such as Riot Games' VALORANT, the design and
                            usability of interface elements play a crucial role in influencing player performance and
                            satisfaction. This study explores the impact of crosshair color on player accuracy and
                            effectiveness within the FPS genre, focusing on its potential to enhance the user experience
                            by optimizing visual clarity and reducing cognitive load.
                            <br><br>
                            FPS games rely heavily on precision, reaction time, and environmental awareness, making
                            the crosshair a vital interface element. The crosshair serves as the player's primary tool for
                            aiming and targeting, and its design can significantly affect gameplay performance. While
                            existing literature in game design and HCI highlights the importance of interface
                            customization (Dye et al., 2009; Johnson & Wiles, 2003), limited research has examined the
                            nuanced role of crosshair aesthetics, particularly color, in FPS games.
                            <br><br>
                            To investigate this, the study utilizes VALORANT's Practice Range—a controlled
                            environment where variables such as enemy behavior and map layout remain consistent—to
                            test the effects of crosshair color on accuracy. Participants are asked to complete
                            standardized drills within the Practice Range using different crosshair colors, with data
                            collected on their performance metrics, such as shot accuracy and target acquisition times.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Method</b><br>
                            This section highlights the methods used during this study. It follows a clear and precise
                            layout, allowing the study to be replicated by any future researchers.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Researcher Preparation</b><br>
                            Before recruiting any participants, there are a few tasks that need to be completed by the
                            researcher, including; ethical checklist, information sheet, consent forms, instruction
                            document, score document, and survey.
                            <br><br>
                            Although ethics checklists are unique to a university environment, it is crucial to still take into
                            consideration, to protect both participants and the researcher.
                            <br><br>
                            The information sheet, which is provided to participants, explains the details of the project,
                            and ethical considerations, such as data collection and how data will be stored. This
                            document also included all points of contact both with the researcher and, in this case, the
                            university and module supervisor.
                            <br><br>
                            The consent form is an agreement between the participant and the researcher. The
                            participants sign the form to agree that they understand; the purpose of the project, they
                            agree to take part, their right to withdraw, their participation is anonymous, and they are over
                            18. They are also given the opportunity to provide an email address to be informed of the
                            project outcomes.
                            <br><br>
                            I then made up a document providing instructions for the specific tasks which the
                            participants were asked to complete for the project. The purpose of this document is to allow
                            the participant to complete the tasks online and in their own time, giving specific instructions
                            for them to follow without the need for the researcher to be present.
                            <br><br>
                            A separate document was also made up, allowing users to enter the scores they obtained
                            whilst doing the tasks. This allowed the participant to see clearly where they needed to enter
                            their data, but also allowed the researcher to have a standardised layout across all
                            participants. The image below shows the table.
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS1.png" alt="Score table." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Score table.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            Finally, a survey was made in order to collect some qualitative data from the participants.
                            This included questions such as; VALORANT rank, which crosshair was easiest to see,
                            which crosshair was hardest to see, if any colours were distracting, and which crosshair they
                            preferred aiming with.
                            <br><br>
                            The information sheet, instructions, consent form, and score document are all put into a
                            google folder. This folder can be duplicated for each participant.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Recruiting Participants</b><br>
                            Participants were recruited primarily through discord. A wide variety of skill levels across
                            VALORANT were seeked out, ranging from iron to immortal. I didn’t take any demographic
                            data throughout the entire project so age and gender amongst participants wasn’t known,
                            except that everyone was over 18.
                            <br><br>
                            After expressing interest, each participant was given their own google folder (containing the
                            information sheet, instructions, consent form and score document), along with a random 3
                            digit number - their unique participant number. This number was randomly generated each
                            time using an online number generator. It allowed the participants' data to remain
                            anonymous.
                            <br><br>
                            Participants were recruited over a two week period, depending on when they expressed
                            interest. Each participant was given notice of a deadline, which ended roughly 2 weeks after
                            the last participant was recruited. The participants were left to complete the tasks in their
                            own time, but they were free to message or email the recruiter with any questions.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Participant Instructions</b><br>
                            This is a copy of the instructions that each participant was given:
                            <br><br><br>
                            <i>
                            <b>Instructions</b><br>
                            Note: any keybindings stated are based on the default keybindings.
                            <br><br>
                            1. Please see the attached google document I sent to you named “Participant 000
                            scores” (where the 000’s are your anonymous participant number) and make yourself
                            familiar with the layout, this is where you will enter your scores.
                            <br><br>
                            2. We are going to add in the crosshair you will be using:
                            <br>
                            a. In VALORANT, go to the settings menu. <br>
                            b. Select the “crosshair” tab. <br>
                            c. Select the import button and enter the code:
                            0;P;u;00FFAEFF;h;0;0t;3;0l;5;0o;2;0a;1;0f;0;1t;4;1l;0;1o;2;1a;1;1m;0;1f;0 <br>
                            d. In order to change the colour of the crosshair, in the same tab select the
                            primary crosshair settings and the top option gives you a dropdown of colours
                            to choose from - for now you can leave it as white.
                            <br>

                            <br><br>
                            7. To start the task, shoot the “start” button on the screen in front of you. 30 Bots will
                            appear one at a time and you will attempt to shoot them before they disappear again.
                            A score will be shown on the screen above you. You may have one run through of
                            the task to familiarise yourself at this point.
                            <br><br>
                            8. Once you are ready, make sure your crosshair is set to white and run through the
                            task, making sure to record your score in the designated document at the end.
                            <br><br>
                            9. Swap your crosshair colour to green and run through the task, recording your score.
                            <br><br>
                            10. Swap your crosshair colour to yellow and run through the task, recording your score.
                            <br><br>
                            11. Swap your crosshair colour to red and run through the task, recording your score.
                            <br><br>
                            12. Repeat steps 8-11, until you have used each colour crosshair 3 times, this means
                            you should run through the task 12 times.

                            Once the participant deadline was reached, the researcher should remove all access to
                            google folders for the participants. Google folders were sorted into completed and
                            uncompleted. All the data from the completed score documents (assuming there is a signed
                            consent form) can be transferred to a google sheet / excel document for detailed data
                            analysis. The details of this analysis will be discussed in the next section of this report -
                            labelled “Results”.

                            The individual participant’s quantitative data can be matched up with their qualitative data via
                            their participation number.

                            At this point, depending on the ethical considerations that were listed in the information
                            sheet, any completed participant folders and the spreadsheet of data should be stored safely
                            inline with these considerations.

                            This section presents the findings on how different crosshair colours affect player accuracy
                            in VALORANT. Firstly, the quantitative data is discussed; showing the raw data, how it was
                            analysed, and the significance of those results. Followed by the qualitative data and its
                            meaning.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Raw Quantitative Data</b><br>
                            Raw data from each participant was taken from their score tables and placed into a Google
                            Sheets spreadsheet. For each crosshair colour an average of their own scores was
                            recorded, along with their overall average performance. An “average difference” was then
                            calculated for each colour by minusing their overall average from their colour specific
                            average. An example of one section of the table is shown below:
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS5.png" alt="Screenshot of the white crosshair average score table." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Screenshot of the white crosshair average score table.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            Using the participant numbers; ranks were assigned to the scores (participant ranks were
                            provided in the survey) and they were grouped by rank. An overall average difference for
                            each crosshair colour, for each rank was calculated by taking an average of all the
                            participants within that group. Below shows a table of the data and a visual bar chart:
                            <br> 
                        </p>

                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Table showing: average scores for each crosshair, in each VALORANT rank.</i></p>

                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Graph showing: average scores for each crosshair, in each VALORANT rank.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            From this raw data alone, we can deduce that the yellow crosshairs overall had a negative
                            impact on the accuracy of the participants, whereas the green appears to have a positive
                            effect. The red crosshair had an effect amongst the middle ranks, but at the higher and lower
                            ends of the scale had very little effect on accuracy. The white crosshair seemed to have the
                            smallest effect overall of all the colours. These results are taken from just the raw data and
                            we cannot know for sure if any of the colours had a significant effect without conducting a
                            hypothesis test, results of this are discussed in the next section.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Analysis of Quantitative Data</b><br>
                            From the raw data we could see a pattern that the yellow crosshair was having a negative
                            impact on the performance of the participants. However, there were no calculations to be
                            sure that it was the crosshair causing the decrease in performance and it wasn’t down to
                            chance.
                            <br><br>
                            In order to justify if the crosshair was causing a significant performance difference, I used a
                            null hypothesis test, with a significance level of 5% (or 0.05). The overall average difference
                            for all the ranks was taken, and each crosshair colour was compared with all the others. The
                            results of this can be seen in the table below:
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS8.png" alt="Table showing hypothesis test values for each colour crosshair." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Table showing hypothesis test values for each colour crosshair.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            A P-value of 0.05 and greater indicates that there is no significant difference between the
                            participants' performance with the crosshair colours. This is indicated by the red highlighting
                            between the red and white, and red and green crosshairs. A P-value lower than 0.05
                            indicates that there is a significant difference between the performance of the colours. This is
                            indicated by the green highlighting on the table.
                            <br><br>
                            This data supports the conclusion that the yellow crosshair was having a negative impact on
                            performance. The yellow crosshair had a p-value lower than the significance level when
                            compared to each of the other colours, meaning there was a significant difference in the
                            performance levels.
                            <br><br>
                            The red crosshair seemed to have the least effect on performance, with only the red vs
                            yellow crosshairs having a significant difference. Whilst the green and white crosshairs both
                            had a slight impact, we know from the data that the green gave a slight positive effect, and
                            the white gave a slight negative effect.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Qualitative Data</b><br>
                            Participants were asked to complete a short survey after they had finished the task in
                            VALORANT. This section will go over the qualitative data that was collected through the
                            survey.
                            <br><br>
                            Participants were first asked about crosshair visibility. The aim of this was to indicate which
                            crosshairs are the easiest/ hardest to see, not the level of performance. The results can be
                            seen below.
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS9.png" alt="Screenshot of the Pie chart showing which crosshairs were easiest to see." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Pie chart showing which crosshairs were easiest to see.</i></p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS10.png" alt="Screenshot of the pie chart showing which crosshairs were hardest to see." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Pie chart showing which crosshairs were hardest to see.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            This illustrates that participants found both the green and white crosshairs easiest to see,
                            and the yellow hardest to see. This does make sense based on the location the task was
                            carried out. In the VALORANT practice range the walls and ceiling have a yellow-ish tint as
                            seen in the picture below:
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS11.png" alt="Screenshot of the VALORANT practice range" width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>VALORANT practice range.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            Participants were then asked which crosshair they preferred aiming with. Although it isn’t
                            asked this was usually the colour they had the best performance on. The results are shown
                            below:
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS12.png" alt="Screenshot of the pie chart showing which crosshair user's prefered aiming with." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Pie chart showing which crosshair user's prefered aiming with.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            As you can see, this pie chart is nearly identical to the chart on “which crosshair did you find
                            easiest to see”. Therefore, we can assume that, with better visibility, the participants
                            preferred aiming with that colour, specifically white and green.
                            <br><br>
                            The participants were asked if any of the colours felt distracting to use, it was hypothesised
                            that if a crosshair was distracting, it would be harder to perform well. The results are shown
                            below:
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Pics/EE%20SS13.png" alt="Screenshot of the bar chart showing which crosshair user's felt distracting." width="500" class="centeredImage">
                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Bar chart showing which crosshair user's felt distracting.</i></p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            As you can see, the yellow crosshair was found to be most distracting, this aligns with the
                            quantitative data that yellow had the most negative impact.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Discussion and Conclusion</b><br>
                            This study highlights the significant impact of crosshair color on aiming accuracy in Valorant.
                            Green crosshairs, with their high contrast and visibility, emerged as the most effective choice
                            for improving performance, while yellow crosshairs hindered accuracy due to their poor
                            contrast with the in-game environment. These results underline the importance of
                            customizable crosshair options in FPS games and suggest that players and developers
                            should prioritize visibility and environmental contrast when designing crosshair elements.
                            <br><br>
                            The findings also underscore the interconnectedness of quantitative and qualitative data in
                            understanding user preferences and performance. For instance, survey feedback indicated
                            that visibility and ease of use directly correlated with performance outcomes, reinforcing the
                            importance of player-centered design in game interfaces. The alignment between
                            participants' subjective preferences and their objective performance outcomes further
                            validates the study’s methodology and results.
                            <br><br>
                            While this research offers valuable insights, it is not without limitations. The controlled
                            environment of Valorant's Practice Range may not fully replicate competitive gameplay
                            conditions, where additional variables such as stress and dynamic environments come into
                            play. Future research could expand on this work by investigating crosshair performance in
                            live matches or exploring additional customization options, such as adaptive crosshairs that
                            change color based on the environment.
                            <br><br>
                            Ultimately, this study contributes to the field of HCI by emphasizing the value of user-driven
                            design in gaming. By prioritizing visibility and usability, game developers can create more
                            engaging and accessible experiences, enhancing both casual and competitive play.
