                        <p>
                            Mood Tracker is a mental health focused web application designed to help users log and reflect on their emotional wellbeing over time. 
                            Users can record their daily mood, add short notes, and view trends through simple charts. 
                            The aim was to create a calm, judgment-free space that encourages self-awareness without pressure or unnecessary gamification.

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            I focused on a clean, minimal, and calming interface, using a soft colour palette and generous whitespace to avoid overwhelming the user. 
                            Navigation was kept simple, with a few main sections, such as; Log Mood and View History.
                            <br><br>
                            The logging screen used clearly labelled mood icons so users could input their feelings quickly while still keeping the process personal and reflective. 
                            Data visualisation was handled with lightweight charts, helping users spot changes in their mood over time without clutter.

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The application was hand-coded from scratch in Visual Studio Code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                            All data was stored using the browser's local storage API, meaning user entries were saved directly to their own device without needing a server or internet connection.
                            <br><br>
                            JavaScript handled:<br>
                            - Saving and retrieving mood entries from local storage.
                            <br>
                            - Dynamically generating charts from stored data.
                            <br>
                            - Smooth UI transitions between logging, viewing history, and insights pages.
                            <br><br>
                            This approach made the app lightweight, fully functional offline, and completely private and no external data storage was involved.    
                        </p>

                        <p class="imageDescription"><i>Adding in a new tracker variable.</i></p>

                    <div class="projectInformation">
                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            As one of my early web projects, Mood Tracker helped me deepen my understanding of client-side storage and structuring interactive applications without backend support. 
                            I learned how to manage persistent data in the browser, update the UI dynamically, and maintain a consistent, calming design language that matched the app's purpose.
                            <br><br>
                            Most importantly, the project reinforced the value of designing with empathy and creating a tool that feels approachable and supportive, which is just as important as making the code work.
