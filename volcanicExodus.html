                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Volcanic Exodus is a solo-developed 3D escape game set on an island moments from eruption. 
                            The player must explore, navigate shifting terrain, and escape before time runs out. 
                            This was my first ever Unity project, which I used as a way to learn the engine through hands-on experimentation. 
                            I used the project as a playground to test Unity's tools; terrain, lighting, audio, scripting, and scene design, building up the game one system at a time.
                            <br><br>
                            The gameplay focuses on rising tension, using visual and audio cues from the volcano to create urgency. 
                            Players are encouraged to learn the landscape and find escape routes.

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            As this was a solo project, I led all aspects of the game's design, learning Unity's tools as I built. 
                            Terrain was sculpted to create verticality and a clear sense of direction, with cliffs and forests acting as natural guides. 
                            The design relied heavily on environmental storytelling which subtly pointed players toward safety or hinted at danger.
                            <br><br>
                            Because this was a learning project, I approached design iteratively: sketching an idea, building it in-engine, testing it, and refining it. 
                            I wanted players to feel pressure but not frustration, so I balanced moments of tension with moments of clarity.

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The project was built in Unity using the built-in terrain tools and a mix of free and self-made assets (built using blender). 
                            I used Unity's fog, lighting, and skybox settings to try and create an oppressive, escalating atmosphere. 
                            Scene transitions and hazard events were managed with basic C# scripts tied to timers and trigger zones.
                            <br><br>
                            A key part of development was learning how to structure and manage Unity projects: organising prefabs, managing references, and debugging scripts. 
                            I created a simple progression system based on elapsed time, triggering effects to communicate that time was running out. 
                            Every system, from collider setup to lighting layers, was something I was learning through the module this project was centered around.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the features I'm most proud of was the custom inventory and crafting system. 
                            Players could chop down trees around the island, which would automatically add wood resources to their inventory UI. 
                            From there, they could visit a crafting bench to convert materials into useful tools or structures.
                            The inventory system used Unity's UI toolkit combined with scriptable objects and clear visual feedback, ensuring that items were tracked, displayed, and consumed correctly. 
                            It added an extra layer of strategy to the escape, encouraging players to explore, gather, and make meaningful decisions under pressure, all within a clean, minimalist interface.

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            Volcanic Exodus was where I learned how I learn best: by building. 
                            As my first official Unity project, it was messy, experimental, and full of trial and error, but it gave me a solid foundation in Unity's core systems. 
                            It taught me the basics of scripting, terrain building, scene setup, event triggers, and player guidance.
                            <br><br>
                            Looking back, it doesn't have the polish of later projects, but I still value it for what it was: 
                            a complete, playable game built from scratch, and proof to myself that I could take an idea and make it real. 
                            It set me up with the confidence to take on bigger, more refined projects, and I've been building ever since.
