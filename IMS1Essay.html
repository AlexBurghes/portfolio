                            <b>Introduction</b><br>
                            Contemporary media operates as an omnipresent force, subtly weaving itself into the fabric of
                            our daily lives. It silently shapes our thoughts, moulds our opinions and influences our
                            behaviour, often without us realising it. Wendy Chun succinctly captures this paradoxical nature
                            of media when she asserts, “Our media matter most when they seem not to matter at all”
                            (2017). This quote encourages us to be critical consumers of media, and recognise the impact
                            that it has goes beyond what we may initially perceive. In this essay, I will explore how
                            contemporary media is integrated into our lives and, with its pervasive influence, how it institutes
                            habits and addiction, reinforces stereotypes and has constructed a symbiotic relationship with
                            society.

                            <b>Habit and Addiction</b><br>
                            The societal habits formed around media are continually erasing the distinction between routine
                            behaviour and addictive tendencies. I believe we, as a society, are shifting from just using
                            media, to relying on media in our daily lives. Wendy Chun (2017) highlights this
                            interconnectedness of habit and addiction, asserting that "habit is becoming addiction: to have is
                            to lose". This concept suggests that habitual behaviours can evolve into addictions, potentially
                            resulting in personal loss or adverse outcomes. For instance, social media platforms foster a
                            "social validation feedback loop" (Seymour, 2019), where users are motivated to seek more
                            'follows,' 'likes,' and 'shares' to gain validation and feel more compelled to engage with the
                            platform. While individuals may initially use social media for communication with peers, for
                            example, they often find themselves drawn into this feedback loop, transitioning from innocent
                            routines to addictive behaviours. This underscores the pervasive influence of media in shaping
                            and amplifying habitual behaviours.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Codependency</b><br>
                            Technology is the backbone of contemporary society, our relationship with the digital world is so
                            interwoven that we each rely on the other for growth and development. I believe that
                            contemporary society is depending on technology for survival. Surry and Baker develop this
                            idea by saying, “technology does not have to play the dominant role in human interaction in
                            order to have a significant impact” (2015). This quote underscores the idea that technology's
                            role in human interactions can be nuanced. It doesn't always have to be the central focus, but it
                            can still have a significant and transformative impact on how it moulds society and how people
                            engage with the world. It encourages a thoughtful and balanced approach to integrating
                            technology into human interactions while recognizing its potential to shape society in various
                            ways. Dutton and Graham also explore this by saying it is “difficult to escape the internet in a
                            wide variety of areas” (2014), implying the internet has become almost ubiquitous. This could be
                            due to factors like the integration of the internet into work, education, entertainment, and
                            communication, making it not just a supplementary or optional feature but a critical component
                            for various activities and services. By building our current society around technological features,
                            we are becoming increasingly more dependent on it for our current survival.
                            <br><br>
                            Human needs and desires drive technological innovation, and technology, in turn, shapes
                            human behaviour, culture, and society. Technology has developed its own behaviour norms,
                            therefore can influence and even reshape the way people act and interact within particular
                            situations or environments. Surry and Baker dive into this idea by stating, “Technology can
                            change what behaviours are considered normal within a given situation” (2015). This quote
                            brings to attention the dynamic relationship between technology and social norms. It highlights
                            that technology has the potential to redefine what is considered normal behaviour within specific
                            situations or context. For example, society has set a stereotype around video games to be a
                            masculine activity, which has led to environments that are “often extremely toxic for women and
                            minorities” (Nakamura, 2014). The language and actions that are performed online would never
                            be accepted within ‘real life’ society, however online it is ignored and almost expected to occur.
                            As a female gamer myself, I can confirm that when I log onto an online game, I am expected to
                            be met with sexist comments. I have never felt that way while walking to a supermarket though
                            and I think that perfectly highlights the divide between online and offline societal norms. As
                            technology continues to advance, it will likely continue to influence and shape the behaviours
                            and expectations of individuals and societies, possibly not for the better.

                            <b>Is Media to Blame?</b><br>
                            While we have examined the intrusive nature of media and its impact on society's evolution, a
                            crucial question arises: to what extent can we attribute responsibility for our thoughts and
                            actions to this technology? It is essential to recognize that technology itself did not
                            autonomously evolve into the backbone of our society; instead, we have actively shaped and
                            integrated it into our daily lives. We have bestowed upon it the power it wields, and, technically,
                            we retain the agency to control its influence. The amount of time an individual spends on their
                            phone, the data they consume, and the impact it has on their lives are ultimately personal
                            choices. It is also essential to acknowledge that companies have learned to exploit the powerful
                            impact of media, enabling them to 'directly manipulate our experience of the world' (Seymour,
                            2019). In this context, media serves as a tool, working in tandem with human psychology to
                            control information, distort facts, and manipulate perceptions. As our society has evolved, we
                            have become exposed to a greater volume of global media, creating the illusion that
                            technological media forms are more influential and pervasive than their predecessors. However,
                            as our understanding of human psychology has deepened, we have gained more tools to
                            navigate and potentially mitigate the impact of media. Is media really as influential and
                            all-encompassing as suggested by Chun, or is it just a tool that humans are exploiting?

                            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                            In conclusion, our relationship with modern media is undeniably complex. While it has the power
                            to shape our thoughts and habits, we cannot solely blame it for our actions. As we continue to
                            evolve alongside advancing technology, it is essential to recognize the intricate interdependence
                            between society and media. We must strive for a better understanding of how media affects us
                            and who wields the power to influence it, as well as acknowledging the potential for positive
                            impacts in education, information dissemination, and entertainment. This ongoing evolution will
                            require a thoughtful, balanced approach to ensure that media continues to serve society's best
                            interests.
