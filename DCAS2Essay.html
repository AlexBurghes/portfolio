                            <b>Introduction</b><br>
                            Interactivity has revolutionised the way we both consume and engage with media, giving
                            users the ability to actively participate in the creation and distribution of online content. It has
                            become an essential component of any and all media formats; video games, social media,
                            mobile apps, websites, to name a few. This essay is going to dive into the concept of
                            interactivity and further how it is allowing the user to be the author in interactive media,
                            drawing on relevant theory and examples.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>How do we Define Interactivity?</b><br>
                            First, it is important to define what is meant by interactivity in the context of interactive
                            media. According to Murray (1997), interactivity refers to “the degree to which the user can
                            participate in modifying the form and content of a mediated environment in real time”. This
                            definition emphasises the role of the user, and magnifies on the idea that they are shaping
                            and modifying the content they interact with, rather than just consuming it passively. In
                            essence, interactivity allows users to interact with media in a way that is meaningful to them,
                            their interests, preferences and desires. It creates a communication channel between both
                            the user and the medium, allowing users to have agency over their experience.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>User Authorship</b><br>
                            The concept of user authorship is integral to interactivity, as it allows users to actively
                            participate in the creation and customisation of their content, hence blurring the lines
                            between consumer and producer. Taking this idea into consideration, interactivity allows the
                            user to become the authors of their experience and the media content they view online. As
                            reported by Bruns (2008), interactivity represents a shift from a focus on production to a
                            focus on “produsage”. Produsage is said to be a form of collaborative production where a
                            user not only consumes content, but also actively produces content, either for themselves or
                            for other users. This shift in focus from the industry from production to produsage
                            emphasises the importance of user authorship in interactive media.
                            <br><br>
                            An example of interactivity mixing with user authorship is fan fiction. This refers to stories or
                            theories written by fans of a particular franchise or series that are set within the world of that
                            franchise. Fan fiction allows users to create their own stories and characters within an
                            already existing narrative, hence continuing to blur the boundaries between producer and
                            consumer. Fan fiction has allowed for increasingly growing communities to form online,
                            which consist of users from all over the world, joining their ideas together to become a major
                            part of the culture and fan base.
                            <br><br>
                            A further example of user authorship is video games. Video games allow users to actively
                            participate in creation of the game’s narrative, with sometimes the action of the user directly
                            consequencing the storyline. This allows the user to become the author of their own
                            experience, shaping the story in a way that is unique to them. Furthermore, with video
                            games becoming an increasingly more popular form of digital entertainment, users can
                            collaborate online to share their experiences together, and subsequently, create infinite more
                            possibilities that one individual could create alone.
                            <br><br>
                            The use of social media is yet another great example of user authorship. Being able to
                            engage in real time with other users from across the globe, creating media content together
                            and interacting with each other's creations. As a result, interactivity has revolutionised the
                            way we, as a society, communicate and share information, with now the majority of users
                            turning to social media as their primary form of news and entertainment.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>User Empowerment</b><br>
                            Interactivity has the potential to empower users, giving them the ability to engage with media
                            in a way that is meaningful to them, specifically allowing them to control their media
                            experiences. One example of this, can be seen in the way that social media platforms such
                            as Twitter, are enabling users to create their own content and interact with others on the
                            platform in real time. This power in interactivity lies in its ability to give users agency over
                            their experiences. A key feature of video games is the sense of empowerment that they
                            provide to users. Users can shape their experiences through the narrative in a way that feels
                            personal and meaningful to them. As Gee (2003) notes, “the power of video games as
                            learning environments lies in the face that they are highly interactive and give the player a
                            great deal of control over his or her own learning.” Video games can be much more than just
                            a source of entertainment; they can provide learning opportunities and areas of skill
                            development. Educational games are designed to teach users about different subjects, for
                            example, “Foldit” is a game which challenges the user to predict how certain proteins will
                            fold, which in broad terms, can help with disease research. Another example would be
                            “Minecraft: Education Edition”, which is a classroom focused version of “Minecraft”. It allows
                            students to tour historical sites and do interactive science experiments for example. This
                            new level of interactive experiences is particularly appealing to users who might feel
                            disempowered, such as young people or users from marginalised communities. However, it
                            is equally valid to address that not all video games are created for the cause of greater
                            social impact. Some games, such as GTA, promote harmful stereotypes and/or promote
                            violence and aggression. As users and developers, it is important to recognise the impact of
                            video games on society and try to create impactful games that promote positive social
                            change.

                            <b>Digital Divide</b><br>
                            The digital divide refers to the gap between those in the population who have access to
                            technology and those who do not have access. Interactivity has the potential to begin to
                            bridge that gap by empowering the user with the ability to create and distribute content.
                            Noted by Fuchs (2014), “interactive media are not only sites of social interaction but also
                            have the potential to enable users to take an active role in their social environment”. For
                            example, modern social media platforms enable users to create their own content and
                            connect with people across the world, regardless of their physical location or socioeconomic
                            status, which even 10-20 years ago would have been a near impossible thought. However, it
                            is important to note that although interactivity can promote collaboration and deliberation, it
                            can also exacerbate existing inequalities, caused by some groups of the population to be
                            “left behind” due to lack of access or resources. In a means to correct this problem, more
                            recent technologies have been developed which are more accessible and user friendly,
                            allowing groups of users who may feel excluded to be connected to the online world.
                            Developers and producers are continuing to address the social and economic inequalities
                            that contribute to the digital divide, and hopefully in another few years, we will be able to
                            banish the thought of any excluded groups, allowing everyone to be able to collaborate and
                            interact no matter the physical distance or economic differences.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Collective Intelligence</b><br>
                            Collective intelligence refers to the idea that a group of individuals working together can
                            create knowledge and solutions that are beyond the capabilities of one individual working
                            alone. The use of interactivity and the ability now to collaborate on projects from across the
                            world enables users to work together and share information, leading to the creation of a
                            collective intelligence. As said by Levy (1997), “the digital medium fosters the creation of a
                            collective intelligence that enables groups to solve problems that would be beyond the reach
                            of any individual”. An example of this in action is Wikipedia, which was created and is
                            maintained by a global community of contributors. Although there are many concerns about
                            the accuracy of Wikipedia, it has been found in studies that it is generally just as accurate as
                            traditional encyclopaedias (Giles,2005). The concept of collective intelligence also applies to
                            social media platforms, which allow users to connect with one another on a global scale.
                            Twitter has been used in the past to mobilise political movements, such as the Arab Spring
                            protests in 2011, or, as another example, to coordinate disaster relief efforts after various
                            natural disasters, this is becoming increasingly more popular after it has shown that it is
                            effective (Palen at al., 2010). Overall, the potential for collective intelligence in relation to
                            interactivity is immense, and it has the power to revolutionise the way we solve problems as
                            a society.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Deliberation</b><br>
                            Interactivity is a key component of deliberation and discussion, allowing the ability to engage
                            with others in real time allows for the exchange of ideas and opinions, leading to a more
                            diverse and informed public discourse. This is particularly relevant in the context of political
                            discourse. Kligker-Vilenchik, Mihailidis, and Lewis (2017) note that “social media platforms
                            have the potential to facilitate deliberative democracy by providing spaces for civic
                            discussion and engagements.” This shows that interactivity can therefore promote a more
                            democratic and inclusive public discourse. Virtual meeting spaces, such as video
                            conferencing and virtual reality environments also offer new opportunities for deliberation in
                            terms of interactive media. Having a platform that allows remote collaboration and
                            communication, allows users from around the world to participate in shared decision-making
                            processes. For example, recently virtual reality has been used in the urban planning
                            industries and architecture, in order to effectively and efficiently plan out areas of land
                            (Hirschberg et al., 2018).
                            <br><br>
                            Another example of deliberation in interactive media, is the use of online forums to facilitate
                            public participation. These forums allow citizens to discuss and debate issues with each
                            other, and with the policy makers themselves, with the target of obtaining a more informed
                            and democratic decision. An example of this in action, would be the European Union, who
                            has previously used online deliberation platforms such as Your Voice to engage citizens in
                            debates about policy issues, ranging from climate change to immigration. This use of
                            deliberation, in theory, allows users to highlight their opinion and concerns, hence helping to
                            shape the way forward in society. Therefore, this use of participatory deliberation gives the
                            user more empowerment and control over the world around them, suggesting that they
                            indeed become more of the “author” of these policies and processes, rather than just a
                            follower of them.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Privacy</b><br>
                            The ability to share personal information while engaging with others in real time raises
                            concerns about the privacy and data protection associated with interactivity. With the
                            proliferation of digital devices and the internet, privacy issues have become increasingly
                            more complex and therefore, difficult to navigate. A primary concern with privacy in
                            interactive media is the collection and use of personal information by companies and
                            organisations. In order to improve user experience, many websites and applications collect
                            user data in order to personalise the content they see and give them a more unique viewing.
                            However, in some cases this data can be sold to third party organisations, to be used for
                            targeted advertising for example, this in turn leads to a higher chance of data breaches,
                            information being stolen, which can possibly cause serious consequences for users.
                            <br><br>
                            In an effort to address these issues, many countries have implemented data protection laws
                            and regulations, for example the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
                            (GDPR) and, in the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). These laws
                            and regulations require companies to obtain user consent for data collection, and also
                            provide clear information with how their data will be used, along with the option for users to
                            access and delete the data upon their request. They are said to be some of the toughest
                            privacy and security laws in the world, with those who violate their standards receiving
                            penalties reaching into millions of euros/dollars.
                            <br><br>
                            Another aspect of privacy in interactive media is the use of encryption and other equal
                            security measures to protect user data from unauthorised access. Encryption is a method of
                            encoding data, which results in it only being able to be accessed and read by authorised
                            parties. It is commonly used in online transactions and private communication. However,
                            there is a debate about the balance between privacy and security, the argument is that
                            although an overly strong encryption seems more private and secure, it can also make it
                            difficult for law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes and protect public safety.
                            Overall the issue of privacy in relation to interactive media is complex and multifaceted, as it
                            requires careful consideration from both individual and societal needs. While data protection
                            laws and encryption technologies do help mitigate the risks, in order to ensure that privacy
                            concerns are adequately addressed in the design and use of interactive media, there needs
                            to be an ongoing dialogue between users, organisations and policy makers.

                            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                            In conclusion, the statement “interactivity is about the user also being an author” is highly
                            relevant in the context of interactive media, as it emphasises the importance of user
                            empowerment and participation in the design and use of digital technologies. Interactivity
                            provides users with the capability to participate in the creation and distribution of content,
                            hence blurring the lines between the producer and the consumer. It has the power to bridge
                            together the social and economical gaps in the digital divide and to promote collective
                            intelligence and deliberation. However, it also presents challenges, particularly around
                            privacy and data protection. The ongoing development of interactive media presents infinite
                            more opportunities, but also challenges, for the future of media and society. Overall,
                            the statement “interactivity is about the user also being an author” highlights the importance
                            of user agency and creativity in the digital age. As interactive media continues to evolve and
                            expand, it is crucial that we remain attentive to all the uses and work together to build an
                            inclusive, empowering and ethical digital future.
