                        <p>
                            Dive into a world of tea and biscuits! 
                            Grab a pack, dunk your favorite biscuits into steaming cups of tea, and see how long you can last without soggy disasters. 
                            Fast-paced, sticky, and utterly delicious!
                            <br><br>
                            Biscuit Blitz is a short, arcade-style PC game built for a one-week game jam.
                            The theme of the game jam was "risk it for the biscuit".
                            <br><br>
                            Players are given a packet of biscuits, with each biscuit acting as a "round." 
                            The goal is to dunk as many biscuits into a cup of tea as possible without letting them break. 
                            Timing is key: dunk too early and the biscuit won't score, leave it too long and it risks going soggy and falling apart. 
                            The player's score accumulates across biscuits, with the game ending either when the packet is finished or when a biscuit breaks.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            The design focuses on simplicity and humour, turning the familiar act of dunking biscuits into a tense, skill-based challenge. 
                            Each biscuit has a randomly generated "safe dunk time," forcing players to judge when to press the spacebar. 
                            The randomness ensures replayability, as no two biscuits play out exactly the same. 
                            Pixel art visuals and playful animations, all created by me, reinforce the lighthearted, jam-friendly aesthetic.

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The game was built in Unity using C# over the course of a week. 
                            A timing system assigns each biscuit a random dunk window, which ranges from 1 to 10 seconds. 
                            The longer the player keeps the biscuit dunked in their teacup, the more their score increases.
                            Score is calculated per successful dunk and added to a running total, while failure conditions (soggy or broken biscuits) immediately end the game. 
                            Therefore players have to choose to risk their biscuit for more points, or play it safe.
                            <br><br>
                            The simple game loop is supported by a clean UI showing the remaining biscuits and total score. 
                            All pixel art assets, including the biscuits, packet, and tea cup, were created by hand for the jam.

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            Biscuit Blitz was an exercise in designing a complete, self-contained game within a strict time limit. 
                            The biggest challenge was balancing the randomness of the dunk timings so that the game felt unpredictable but fair. 
                            Playtesting with family helped tune this balance and keep the core loop fun and tense. 
                            Creating all of the pixel art assets myself also gave me practice in defining a cohesive, charming visual style under pressure.
                            <br><br>
                            I am currently working on adapting Biscuit Blitz into a mobile version as I believe that suits the style of the game. 
                            This will involve reworking the control scheme for touch input, adjusting the UI and optimising the flow for shorter, more casual play sessions.
