                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Game Tracker is a mobile app designed to help users keep track of the games they've played, are currently playing, or plan to play. 
                            Built in Android Studio using Kotlin, the app allows users to log titles, platforms, progress status, and personal notes in a clean and simple interface. 
                            It was designed as a practical tool for both casual and serious gamers who want an easy way to manage their backlog without relying on cluttered spreadsheets or memory alone.

                        <h3>Desgin Process</h3>
                        <p>The idea for Game Tracker came from my own experience trying to remember which games I'd started, which ones I'd dropped, and which I was excited to try next. 
                            I started by sketching out a simple layout; one that would make adding and reviewing games quick and satisfying. 
                            I didn't want the UI to feel bloated or overcomplicated, so I focused on a minimal card-based design with clearly separated fields for title, platform, progress, and notes.
                            <br><br>
                            Progress tracking was a key part of the design. 
                            I wanted users to easily mark games as "Not Started," "Playing," "Paused," or "Completed," and eventually added simple color-coded indicators to reflect those states at a glance. 
                            I also paid attention to input flow, making sure adding a new game felt lightweight, not like filling out a form. 
                            The result is something that feels personal, simple, and fast.

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>The app was built in Android Studio using Kotlin, with a focus on maintaining clean separation between UI and data logic. 
                            I used a RecyclerView to display the list of games, with each entry rendered as a custom card layout. 
                            Users can add games via a separate form activity, and their entries are stored locally so the data persists between sessions.
                            <br><br>
                            I kept the data structure simple but scalable, using Kotlin classes to hold each game's info and implementing local storage (either through a file or SharedPreferences, depending on the version). 
                            The app uses standard Android components like Intents, Adapters, and ViewHolders, with logic spread across multiple scripts to keep things modular and easy to maintain.
                            <br><br>
                            To make the app more dynamic, I integrated the Steam Web API. 
                            This allowed users to search for and add games directly from Steam's database, and also fetch achievement data for any linked titles. 
                            This gave the app a smarter, more automated feel, users didn't have to manually input everything, and it added extra context to each game.
                            <br><br>
                            Separately, I developed a sign-in system where users could link their Steam account to automatically sync their library and achievements. 
                            However, since this required user authentication and secure API key access, I removed the login system for the final version so it could be marked and tested without external dependencies. 
                            The core sign-in code is still commented out in the project for future use or to reference back to if I need.
                            <br><br>
                            As a smaller technical exercise, I also experimented with camera and gallery access, allowing users to attach a photo to a game entry. 
                            This wasn't a core feature but helped me practice working with Android's permissions and media APIs.
                            <br><br>
                            Throughout development, I made use of loops, conditional statements, and script communication to handle actions like filtering, sorting, and updating entries. 
                            I also made sure to include features like editing existing entries and high-level progress summaries, ensuring the app stayed useful even as users added more games.

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>This project gave me the chance to build something both useful and personal, while also exploring API integration and mobile system features. 
                            If I were to expand Game Tracker, I'd start by reactivating the Steam account sign-in to allow full syncing of game libraries and achievement progress. 
                            With that, the app could become a more powerful and automatic tracking tool and one that pulls in game data rather than relying on manual entry.
                            <br><br>
                            I'd also like to develop advanced filtering, sorting, and analytics tools, like viewing completion stats over time, or sorting games by genre or platform. 
                            The core obstacle here wasn't technical difficulty but time and project scope.
                            <br><br>
                            Practicing with things like camera access, real-time data fetching, and account integration gave me valuable insight into Android's capabilities and made this project more than just a list app. 
                            It became a small ecosystem of game tracking features that I'm excited to expand on in the future.
