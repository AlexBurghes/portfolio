                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Anatidie is a comedic twin-stick shooter with roguelike and bullet heaven influences, developed as part of a group project. 
                            Inspired by a parody of Lovecraftian horror, the game explores the absurd idea of a cult summoning an arcane horror, only for it to take the form of a goose. 
                            Across five minutes and three escalating levels, players control the goose and attempt to survive waves of enemies, growing in power with each run. 
                            The project aimed to subvert typical genre expectations by mixing dark themes with light-hearted humour, timed levels, multiple classes, and a replayable structure designed for exhibition settings.

                        <h3>Group Meetings</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a team of four active members (after one group member became inactive), we adopted a structured yet flexible workflow. 
                            We held two main meetings per week: a Tuesday check-in for wellbeing and informal discussion, and a Thursday scrum session focused on weekly tasks and formal feedback with our Scrum Master. 
                            This balance helped foster a collaborative and supportive environment where ideas could be shared openly. 
                            Roles were divided based on individual interests and strengths, with a technical lead, project lead, and two design-focused members, including myself as design lead. 
                            Communication was key, especially when addressing conflicts or feedback challenges, and we worked hard to maintain professionalism even in difficult conversations.

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            As Design Lead, I was responsible for the overall visual direction of the game. 
                            I produced the majority of the 3D models in Blender, including environmental assets, props, and characters. 
                            I also rigged and animated key models, most notably the goose and cultists, which were later implemented into Unity by the Tech Lead. 
                            To streamline teamwork, I created a model tracking system in our group Discord using a traffic light method to avoid duplication and identify outstanding tasks. 
                            Each member of the design team took on one level; I designed one of the three, from initial sketches through to asset placement in Unity. 
                            I also created additional props where needed to support the level builds. 
                            While the Team Lead handled materials and colours in Unity, I ensured all assets were properly prepared, named, and exported for easy integration.

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The game was developed in Unity by the Tech Lead, who set up the core systems including enemy behaviour, player controls, UI, and progression logic. 
                            We followed an agile, continuous integration approach where primitives were used early on and replaced with final assets as they became available. 
                            Although I was not directly involved in the Unity programming, I supported implementation by ensuring all Blender files were clean, rigged correctly, and exported in compatible formats. 
                            I worked closely with the Tech Lead to test animations and helped troubleshoot any asset import issues, 
                            particularly during the final polish phase when animations and physics interactions became more complex.

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project was a major learning experience for me, both technically and personally. 
                            At the start, I was nervous about working in a group setting, but over time I became more confident and comfortable in my role. 
                            I significantly improved my 3D modelling skills in Blender, especially in terms of efficiency and complexity, and also learned how to rig and animate models independently. 
                            Organisationally, I discovered the value of consistent task planning and communication, even if I sometimes felt unsure whether I was contributing enough. 
                            Overall, I'm proud of what we produced as a team and of my individual contributions. 
                            I'd now feel far more prepared for future group-based development projects.
