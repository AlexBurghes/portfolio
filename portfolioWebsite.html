                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            This ongoing project is my personal portfolio website, a central archive for my creative and technical work. 
                            I wanted a space that wasn't just a strictly professional showcase, but also a personal record of my projects over time. 
                            While its purpose is functional, I also wanted it to feel like my space, with a design that reflects my style. 
                            It's not 'finished', and hopefully never will be, as it's intended to grow and evolve alongside my skills and projects.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started with some rough sketches and layout ideas, focusing on clarity and visual appeal rather than complexity. 
                            The aim was to create a clean, accessible space that was easy to navigate while still feeling personal. 
                            I avoided overly corporate or sterile styles in favour of something more approachable and representative of me as a creator. 
                            The structure allows for quick additions, so I can keep expanding it without needing a full redesign every time.

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The site was hand-built from scratch using HTML and CSS, without relying on frameworks or site builders. 
                            Although I initially considered JavaScript for certain features, the simplicity of the site meant it wasn't necessary. 
                            This kept the build lightweight and easy to maintain. 
                            A big part of the process was curating, formatting, and uploading all my past work, making sure images, descriptions, and files were consistent and accessible.

                    <div class="projectInformation">
                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            Even though the portfolio isn't technically complex, building it myself gave me complete control over how my work is presented. 
                            It reinforced the value of creating systems that are flexible and future-proof, and it's already made keeping track of my projects much easier. 
                            More than anything, it's a reminder that not every project needs to be flashy to be valuable, sometimes the best tools are the ones that quietly make your life easier every day.
