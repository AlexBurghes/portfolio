                            <b>Introduction</b><br>
                            Failure is often seen as the opposite of success, a negative outcome to be
                            avoided. However, in the context of video games, failure is not only expected but
                            deliberately designed. It serves as a mechanic that shapes player experience,
                            emotional investment, and long-term engagement. In games, failure can take
                            many forms: mechanical, narrative, social, or philosophical, and each type
                            influences how players interact with the game’s systems. This essay defines
                            failure as any disruption of the player's intended outcome, whether through loss,
                            rejection of agency, or unmet expectations. Unlike other media, games require
                            active participation, which means that failure becomes a functional part of the
                            experience rather than a narrative endpoint. The way games balance frustration
                            and reward through failure is central to their emotional and psychological
                            appeal.
                            <br><br>
                            Videogames balance frustration and reward by transforming failure into
                            engagement. This essay examines narrative failure in The Stanley Parable and
                            competitive mechanical failure in VALORANT to explore how games manipulate
                            player psychology to sustain motivation despite, or because of: failure. While
                            these games belong to radically different genres, they both use failure as a tool
                            for player immersion and reflection. The following sections will establish a
                            theoretical framework for understanding failure in games, before analysing how
                            each case study constructs and deploys failure. A comparative analysis will then
                            show how frustration can be used to shape emotional and psychological
                            responses across different game types, revealing failure as a sophisticated and
                            versatile design strategy.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>The Paradox of Failure</b><br>
                            Jesper Juul identifies a central paradox in game design: “players want to feel
                            competent, yet they choose to play games that make them feel incompetent”
                            (Juul, 2013). This contradiction lies at the heart of why failure is not only
                            tolerated in games but actively sought. Unlike traditional media, games
                            challenge the player’s agency and ability, meaning that failure isn’t a byproduct;
                            it’s a design goal. A game without the possibility of failure cannot truly challenge
                            the player, and thus cannot offer a satisfying sense of accomplishment. Failure,
                            then, is not a flaw in design but a fundamental component of engagement.
                            <br><br>
                            Katherine Isbister adds an emotional dimension to this discussion, arguing that
                            failure in games is not purely mechanical but also deeply affective. It can evoke
                            emotions such as: shame, pride, anticipation, and relief, making the player’s
                            experience more immersive and personal (Isbister, 2017). These emotional
                            responses are designed, not incidental. By creating moments of tension and
                            frustration, developers give players a reason to care. Emotional investment
                            increases when the player feels they have something at stake, and it is often the
                            threat or reality of failure that generates those stakes. As such, failure plays a
                            crucial role in shaping emotional intensity in gameplay.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Challenge, Flow, and Learning</b><br>
                            The psychological underpinning of failure’s effectiveness can be found in Mihaly
                            Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow. Flow is a state of optimal experience
                            achieved when a person’s skills are in perfect balance with a task’s challenges
                            (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In the context of games, flow is central to sustained
                            engagement. If the challenge is too low, players become bored; if it is too high,
                            they become anxious or frustrated. Many games intentionally operate close to
                            the upper edge of this threshold, pushing players toward failure in order to
                            maintain engagement. The temporary discomfort of failure becomes motivation
                            to improve and re-enter the flow state.
                            <br><br>
                            Raph Koster supports this view by suggesting that fun in games is primarily
                            derived from learning. In his view, “games are fun because they teach us things
                            in a very fundamental way” (Koster, 2013). Failure is not a barrier to enjoyment
                            but a signal that there is something new to master. Through repeated attempts,
                            players learn patterns and adjust strategies. This loop of trial, error, and
                            improvement is what makes games both educational and enjoyable. Whether in
                            a high-pressure tactical shooter like “VALORANT” or a narrative experiment like
                            “The Stanley Parable”, failure facilitates progress and engagement.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Rules, Fiction, and Frustration</b><br>
                            Jesper Juul’s theory of games as “half-real” further illuminates the experience of
                            failure. Games are composed of two intertwined layers: the rules that govern
                            mechanics and the fictional world that gives them context (Juul, 2005). Players
                            are often willing to accept surreal or abstract narrative settings as long as the
                            rules remain consistent. Fairness in rules helps justify failure, even when the
                            story elements are strange or confusing. This duality allows players to invest in
                            the challenge and make sense of their setbacks.
                            <br><br>
                            However, some games use this dual structure to create deliberate frustration.
                            The Stanley Parable disrupts both its mechanical and fictional consistency,
                            denying the player a sense of agency. It presents choices and then ridicules the
                            player for making them, creating a sense of disorientation. Failure in this context
                            is not about losing a game state but about failing to assert control or find
                            meaning. This kind of narrative frustration shows how failure can serve a
                            thematic function, raising questions about free will, authorship, and the role of
                            the player within the game world.
                            <br><br>
                            Having established the emotional, cognitive, and theoretical dimensions of
                            failure in games, the essay now turns to two case studies that handle failure and
                            frustration in contrasting ways. The Stanley Parable uses failure to unsettle and
                            reflect, challenging the very nature of player agency. VALORANT, by contrast,
                            channels failure into mastery and competition, where each loss offers the
                            potential for growth. Together, they demonstrate the flexibility and power of
                            failure as a core game mechanic.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>The Stanley Parable: Failure of Agency and Meaning</b><br>
                            <b>Introduction to The Stanley Parable</b><br>
                            Released in 2013 by Galactic Cafe, The Stanley Parable is a narrative-driven
                            exploration game that challenges conventional ideas of player choice and
                            agency. Rather than relying on mechanical difficulty, the game is constructed
                            around narrative subversion, where failure is not the result of poor performance
                            but an inevitable part of the game’s design. Set in an empty office complex,
                            players control Stanley, a silent office worker who discovers one day that all of
                            his coworkers have vanished. As a disembodied narrator guides and comments
                            on the player’s actions, the game explores themes of control, obedience, and
                            the illusion of free will. The Stanley Parable is not about winning or mastering
                            mechanics, it is about confronting the structures of meaning that games (and
                            players) often take for granted. It reframes failure not as a setback but as the
                            core of its narrative and philosophical engagement.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Constructing Failure Through Narrative</b><br>
                            At its core, The Stanley Parable constructs failure through the deliberate
                            breakdown of agency. While the game appears to offer choices: left or right,
                            obey or disobey, the outcomes are tightly scripted, and the illusion of freedom is
                            consistently undermined. Regardless of the path taken, the player cannot
                            achieve a definitive victory. Each narrative branch loops back into another form
                            of failure: either the story ends abruptly, Stanley dies, the world resets, or the
                            narrator mocks the futility of the player’s decisions. This recursive structure
                            exposes the artificiality of agency in games. By denying players the satisfaction
                            of “winning”, The Stanley Parable forces them to confront how constrained their
                            choices truly are.
                            <br><br>
                            This design exemplifies Jesper Juul’s paradox of failure. As Juul (2013) argues,
                            players enter games seeking competence but are often drawn to experiences
                            that repeatedly make them feel incompetent. In The Stanley Parable, this
                            incompetence is not based on mechanical challenge, but on the player’s lack of
                            narrative control. The game creates what might be called “structured
                            incompetence”: a scenario where every option feels meaningless, yet the player
                            continues to search for a better outcome. It frustrates the expectation that effort
                            should lead to mastery, and replaces success with existential uncertainty. In
                            doing so, it creates a space where failure becomes the dominant mode of
                            interaction.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Subverting Game Logic and the Absurd</b><br>
                            This rejection of conventional game logic is further illuminated by Espen
                            Aarseth’s concept of ergodic literature. Aarseth (1997) defines ergodic texts as
                            those which require nontrivial effort from the reader or player to traverse. In most
                            games, this effort is rewarded with progression or success. The Stanley Parable
                            subverts this model by requiring effort that yields no meaningful reward. The
                            player explores, restarts, experiments, and is constantly looped back into failure.
                            This inversion breaks the traditional link between input and outcome, reframing
                            gameplay as a critique of interactive structure itself. The game becomes a
                            commentary on the futility of seeking coherence or control in systems that are
                            fundamentally pre-written.
                            <br><br>
                            This futility resonates with the philosophical framework of absurdism, particularly
                            in the work of Albert Camus. Camus (1942) describes the absurd condition as
                            the conflict between the human desire for meaning and the silent indifference of
                            the universe. In The Stanley Parable, players are trapped in this absurd
                            condition. They perform actions, follow paths, disobey, restart, and yet achieve
                            nothing lasting. Like Sisyphus pushing his boulder uphill, the player is
                            condemned to repetition without resolution. The game’s narrator mirrors this
                            tension, by offering commentary that oscillates between humor, sarcasm, and
                            despair. In embracing the absurd, the game uses failure as a form of
                            philosophical engagement. The player is invited to find meaning not in
                            outcomes, but in the act of playing itself.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Anti-Flow and Intentional Frustration</b><br>
                            This approach also functions as a deliberate inversion of Csikszentmihalyi’s flow
                            theory. As discussed earlier, flow is achieved when there is a balance between
                            challenge and skill (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). The Stanley Parable disrupts this
                            entirely. There is no skill curve, no mastery, and no progression. Instead, players
                            encounter constant narrative disruption, unpredictability, and emotional
                            dissonance. The game creates intentional anti-flow: a state of unease and
                            confusion that draws attention to the medium itself. Rather than immersing the
                            player, it continually breaks immersion in order to provoke reflection. This is not
                            an accident, but a core part of its design philosophy.

                            <b>Player Impact and the Value of Failure</b><br>
                            The emotional impact of this failure-first design is complex. Players may feel
                            confused, frustrated, or amused, often within the same playthrough. The tone of
                            the game, driven by the narrator’s voice, swings from dry wit to existential
                            commentary. This unpredictability fosters a sense of critical distance. Rather
                            than mastering a system, players are invited to question it. The reward becomes
                            interpretive, not mechanical. Engagement is sustained not by flow or
                            competition, but by curiosity; what else can the game do, how far can it go, what
                            other endings might reveal new insights?
                            <br><br>
                            In this sense, The Stanley Parable offers a positive experience of failure. It
                            reframes failure as an opportunity for reflection rather than a sign of inadequacy.
                            The player’s inability to win becomes the very thing that makes the game
                            compelling. This subversion of traditional gameplay expectations not only
                            challenges how games are played but also how they are understood. Through
                            narrative recursion, absurdist tone, and intentional frustration, The Stanley
                            Parable turns failure into its most powerful design tool.

                            <b>VALORANT: Competitive Failure and High-Stakes Reward</b><br>
                            <b>Introduction to VALORANT</b><br>
                            Released in 2020 by Riot Games, VALORANT is a free-to-play tactical
                            first-person shooter that places strong emphasis on precision, team
                            coordination, and strategic planning. The game features round-based combat
                            where players are divided into two teams, with one team attacking and the other
                            defending. Each player selects an "agent", with unique abilities that complement
                            traditional gunplay. Unlike narrative-driven games, VALORANT is designed
                            around mechanical mastery and competitive play. Its high skill ceiling ensures
                            that failure is not only frequent but also central to the experience. This case
                            study explores how VALORANT incorporates failure through mechanical, social,
                            and psychological systems, ultimately reinforcing long-term player engagement.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Systems of Failure in VALORANT</b><br>
                            Failure in VALORANT occurs frequently and in multiple forms. Mechanical
                            failure is the most immediate and visible. Players may miss a crucial shot,
                            mismanage a one-versus-one encounter, or mis-time an ability, resulting in
                            near-instant elimination from a round. The stakes of each interaction are high,
                            and the margin for error is small. Unlike games that offer retries or checkpoints,
                            VALORANT punishes mistakes with instant consequences. These mechanical
                            failures accumulate and form a core part of the player’s learning curve.
                            <br><br>
                            Social and team-based failure adds another layer of complexity. Because
                            VALORANT is a team game, individual performance is deeply interwoven with
                            the actions of others. Poor communication or missed callouts can lead to a
                            round loss. These losses often feel deeply personal, even if they are caused by
                            others. This dynamic creates a psychological feedback loop where the player
                            feels responsible not only for their own mistakes, but for the team’s overall
                            performance.
                            <br><br>
                            Cumulative failure is another key element. VALORANT is structured in a series
                            of rounds, and losing multiple rounds in succession can create emotional
                            pressure and frustration. A bad start can snowball into a full match loss, and the
                            stakes grow with each failed round. This accumulation of failure intensifies the
                            emotional experience of gameplay, as the cost of each mistake compounds over
                            time. As Juul (2013) explains, players pursue competence but are frequently
                            met with micro-failures. In VALORANT, these micro-failures build a narrative of
                            personal and team struggle, reinforcing the challenge and heightening the
                            reward when success is finally achieved.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Theoretical Frameworks for Competitive Failure</b><br>
                            Flow theory, as proposed by Csikszentmihalyi (1990), provides a useful
                            framework for understanding player engagement in VALORANT. Flow occurs
                            when there is a perfect balance between a player’s skill level and the challenge
                            presented. However, this balance can easily be disrupted by poor matchmaking,
                            team imbalance, or inconsistent performance. When the challenge becomes too
                            difficult or easy, flow is broken, and the player experiences frustration or
                            boredom. In VALORANT, flow is a fragile state that players continually chase.
                            When achieved, it produces intense immersion, but when broken, it leads to
                            sharp emotional dips. These fluctuations between flow and failure keep the
                            player engaged, driven to improve and regain that balance.
                            <br><br>
                            B.F. Skinner’s operant conditioning, particularly the model of partial
                            reinforcement, also plays a role in VALORANT’s design. According to this
                            model, unpredictable and intermittent rewards are highly effective at sustaining
                            behavior over time (Skinner, 1953). In VALORANT, success is not guaranteed.
                            Players may experience long stretches of failure punctuated by small but
                            meaningful victories—a well-timed clutch or a successful round. These small
                            wins act as reinforcement, encouraging continued play despite frequent
                            setbacks. This partial reinforcement system keeps the player hooked, as the
                            next success always feels just within reach.
                            <br><br>
                            Loss aversion, a principle from behavioural economics introduced by Tversky
                            and Kahneman (1991), further explains the emotional impact of failure in
                            competitive games. Their research shows that people perceive losses more
                            intensely than equivalent gains. In the context of VALORANT, this means that
                            losing a match or a crucial round often feels more impactful than winning. The
                            emotional weight of failure can lead to frustration, but it also raises the stakes of
                            success. Because losses are felt so deeply, victories in turn become even more
                            rewarding. The game amplifies emotional highs and lows, creating a compelling
                            play experience.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Emotional and Motivational Impact on the Player</b><br>
                            The emotional experience of failure in VALORANT is intense. Players often feel
                            adrenaline, anxiety, anger, or even exhilaration during and after matches. The
                            high-stakes nature of the game means that every decision, every shot, and
                            every strategy carries significant weight. These emotions are not purely
                            negative. They are part of what makes the game exciting and satisfying.
                            Short-term frustration is balanced by long-term engagement. Players invest time
                            not because the game is easy, but because improvement is visible and
                            meaningful.
                            <br><br>
                            Over time, players develop goals related to skill improvement. They review
                            mistakes, practice mechanics, and build communication strategies. Failure
                            becomes a motivator for self-improvement. This makes success feel genuinely
                            earned, particularly in high-pressure moments like clutch plays or match
                            victories. These rare, rewarding moments are disproportionately powerful
                            because they stand in contrast to the frequent failures that precede them. In this
                            way, VALORANT turns competitive failure into a driver of engagement and
                            mastery.

                            and Reward</b><br>
                            <b>Types of Failure: Narrative vs Competitive</b><br>
                            The Stanley Parable and VALORANT both rely on failure as a central mechanic,
                            but the nature of that failure differs fundamentally. In The Stanley Parable,
                            failure is philosophical and narrative. The player encounters the illusion of
                            agency, where every decision leads to an unsatisfying conclusion. Success is
                            deliberately withheld, making failure a thematic and structural tool. In contrast,
                            VALORANT centres on mechanical and competitive failure. Players miss shots,
                            lose rounds, and are frequently outperformed by opponents. This failure is not
                            abstract, but immediate and skill-based. While both games frustrate players,
                            they do so through distinct systems that reflect their genre and goals. One
                            undermines narrative expectation; the other challenges mechanical proficiency.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Emotional and Psychological Response to Failure</b><br>
                            The emotional outcomes of failure in each game differ significantly. In The
                            Stanley Parable, frustration provokes reflection. The lack of meaningful progress
                            and the absurdity of the game’s logic encourages players to question their
                            expectations of interactivity and narrative control. This leads to an emotional
                            state rooted in curiosity, irony, or existential discomfort. By contrast, VALORANT
                            channels frustration into motivation. Losses can be infuriating, but they often
                            result in a drive to improve. Players analyse mistakes, train their aim, or work on
                            communication, seeking redemption in the next match. In both cases, the
                            games turn negative emotions into engagement, but they do so through different
                            emotional trajectories: one through reflection, the other through competition and
                            mastery.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Balancing Frustration and Reward in Game Design</b><br>
                            Both games offer carefully crafted systems to manage frustration and sustain
                            player interest. The Stanley Parable uses narrative loops, humour, and
                            meta-commentary to soften the sting of failure. The narrator’s wit and the
                            game’s unpredictable endings keep players intrigued, even when outcomes are
                            intentionally unsatisfying. This turns failure into a playful experience.
                            VALORANT, on the other hand, offsets frustration with partial rewards. Small
                            victories, like winning a clutch round or landing a difficult shot, serve as
                            emotional payoffs. The ranked progression system also gives players tangible
                            markers of improvement, even in defeat. These design strategies reflect the
                            demands of their respective genres. Narrative games reward persistence with
                            insight; competitive games reward persistence with measurable growth. Both
                            approaches show how frustration, when designed effectively, can become a
                            powerful tool for sustained engagement.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                            Failure in video games is far more than an obstacle to success; it is a central
                            mechanic through which games generate emotional intensity, cognitive
                            engagement, and sustained motivation. By examining The Stanley Parable and
                            VALORANT, this essay has demonstrated how games transform frustration into
                            a meaningful part of the player experience. While the two case studies operate
                            in different genres, both use failure to shape how players think and ultimately
                            drive them to continue playing. In The Stanley Parable, failure is philosophical
                            and narrative. The player is confronted with the illusion of choice and forced to
                            reflect on the meaning of their actions. This disruption of agency leads to a form
                            of engagement rooted in critical thought and curiosity. In contrast, VALORANT
                            presents failure as a mechanical and competitive challenge. Players regularly
                            lose rounds, make mistakes, and face the consequences of their actions in real
                            time. Yet this consistent exposure to defeat becomes a motivating factor,
                            encouraging players to improve and strive toward excellence.
                            <br><br>
                            The theoretical frameworks of Juul’s paradox of failure, Csikszentmihalyi’s flow
                            theory, Aarseth’s ergodic literature, and psychological models such as operant
                            conditioning and loss aversion reveal the complexity of failure in game design.
                            Whether used to provoke existential reflection or competitive drive, failure
                            becomes a tool that designers use to deepen emotional investment and
                            encourage continued interaction. By manipulating how and why players fail,
                            games transform what should be a deterrent into a source of meaning,
                            challenge, and enjoyment. Failure, far from being a flaw in game design, is what
                            makes games worth playing.
