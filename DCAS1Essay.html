                            <b>Introduction</b> <br>
                            Traditionally stories are accounts of a series of past events, either true or fictional, told in
                            such a way that the listener experiences or learns something just from hearing the story.
                            With the development of technology and media, a new type of storytelling has emerged,
                            interactive stories. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to interactive storytelling, it is
                            generally agreed upon that non-linear branching structures are a key element of successful
                            interactive narratives. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why non-linear branching
                            structures are essential to interactive stories, drawing on theory about stories and using
                            examples of interactive games, in relation to player agency, to illustrate these points.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Player Agency and the Power of Choice</b><br>
                            The application for greater player agency, the ability for a player to impact a story through
                            game design or gameplay, is one of the main reasons why non-linear branching structures
                            are so important in interactive stories. Giving the audience the control to make decisions that
                            can and will change the direction of the story creates a much more immersive and engaging
                            experience as they can actively participate in the story rather than watching it unfold. Player
                            agency can be further split into theoretical agency, the player’s ability to change the course
                            of their experience, and perceived agency, the player’s perception of their ability to make
                            such changes and finding the balance between the two can maximise the player agency
                            perceived by players. Although theoretical agency can allow a player to literally change a
                            story, it isn’t always guaranteed to convince the player that they are in control of their
                            experience. Highlighted in Thompson et al. 's work, four conditions can be set:
                            “foreseeability, ability, desirability, and connection”. By accentuating all these conditions by
                            using both theoretical and perceived agency you can ensure the player is satisfied that they
                            are in complete control of not only their story but their experience. (As cited in Thue, D.,
                            Bulitko, V., Spetch, M., Romanuik, T., 2010). Throughout this essay we are going to address
                            each of these conditions, and how they each serve their particular purpose in developing a
                            successful player agency, hence creating an immersive interactive story with non-linear
                            branching structures.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Foreseeability: Signposting Player Impact</b><br>
                            During an interactive story game, players will always be presented with choices. Some of
                            these choices may result in different outcomes based on the players actions, others might
                            not change the outcome, but the path to act on those choices might provide for different
                            gameplay experiences. The difference in these choices doesn’t take away any of the
                            meaning, giving players the opportunity to express their choices and options allows them to
                            feel in control of their path, even if the story progresses identically with either choice
                            (Bittencourt B., 2019). If however, a player is unaware that their actions in a given moment
                            are actually a choice between two or more different situations, that is when a choice
                            becomes meaningless. The player has missed the experience of having to process their
                            decisions and analyse certain situations. Instead of feeling the responsibility of their actions,
                            the player will view the consequences of that action as inevitable, leading to less emotional
                            connection with the game, which we will cover more on later in this essay. (Morrison B.,
                            2013). In the video game, Detroit: become human (2018), the player will follow three main
                            characters in a dynamic storyline, which branches out corresponding to the choices the
                            player makes. Over the course of the game a flowchart is displayed to the player, indicating
                            the path the storyline is heading. This provides the player with clear meaning behind their
                            actions which can range from wars breaking out to peace talks. Throughout the story,
                            players are shown all the choices they can make, and how those decisions alter the storyline
                            of the game.This is a prime example of the foreseeability that interactive stories involve, and
                            combined with the other 3 main conditions, can convince players that they alone hold the
                            responsibility of the consequences that came with their choices.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Desirability: Making Choices Meaningful</b><br>
                            Now we have discussed the importance of choices, we must think about why a player might
                            want to commit to certain actions. A good consequential choice should have both an
                            aesthetic and gameplay component. Not only is the player’s game going to look different, but
                            it will also have different gameplay, a different experience, and overall, the memory of the
                            game will be completely unique (Morrison B., 2013). Pokémon (1996-2022) is a franchise of
                            games where players act as trainers in a virtual world to collect and train Pokémon with two
                            main story-based goals. These goals in themselves are very linear; complete a Pokédex by
                            collecting all available Pokémon species, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon to defeat
                            gyms in a specific order resulting in becoming the regional champion. However, even with
                            these two linear objectives, Pokémon offers a unique gameplay experience based entirely
                            on the player’s decisions. Originally starting the game, players have the choice of
                            customising their character, choosing a name, a gender and, in the more recent games,
                            even certain characteristics like race and hair colour. This immediately indulges the player to
                            personalise their gameplay and, as they themselves created that character, allows them to
                            connect emotionally with the game. From there the customisation becomes nearly infinite;
                            with the order in which they catch Pokémon, to the type of Pokémon they choose to train, to
                            the attacks and evolutions they give their Pokémon. All these choices are presented to the
                            player, and the importance of those choices is that they allow for a new level of
                            customisation and personalisation resulting in completely unique gameplay for every player,
                            depending on the experience they want from the game. This ability for the gameplay to vary
                            depending on the desires of the player gives the perception of control, even in what would
                            seem to be a linear story-based game, like Pokémon.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Connection: Emotional Investment and Empathy</b><br>
                            Every story has an element of connection, a reason to listen, to watch, to play. Interactive
                            storytelling gives a new dimension of connection: emotional connection. The ability to alter
                            and change the path of a character through a story changes the very meaning of the story,
                            these characters become real, they’re heroes, friends and enemies, the player cares what
                            happens to them and empathises with them. By putting themselves in the shoes of the
                            character and making decisions for that character the player alone holds the responsibility
                            for any consequences that come. That connection with the characters is something that
                            story games can use to not only make them physically interactive but also emotionally
                            interactive, as, depending on the background and situation of a player, they may feel
                            stronger empathy to certain characters that they can relate to. (Lebowitz J., Klug C., 2011).
                            The Last of Us Part 1 (2013) is an action-adventure game where players control Joel, a
                            father who watched his daughter get shot to death, who is tasked with escorting a teenage
                            girl, Ellie, across America in a post-apocalyptic world. Although The Last of Us has a linear
                            storyline, it is presented in a way that the player will feel empathy for Joel and Ellie, the
                            depth of this empathy will vary between players based on their own morals and life
                            experiences. This emotional connection to the characters can, and does, result in players
                            choosing to take certain strategic pathways in order to; collect more equipment, such as
                            better weapons and more heath kits, or to avoid combat, in order to save resources and not
                            risk death, or to run into the enemies and have a game of pure combat. All these options will
                            result in the same storyline, however, the ability to choose these precise moments of
                            gameplay, based on the players perception of what the characters would do, allows for linear
                            games to have non-linear structures which still convince players they are creating unique
                            storylines.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Ability: Enabling Player Control Within Limits</b><br>
                            Possibly the most obvious of the four conditions is ability. The ability for players to do
                            something, to make that decision or take a different direction. This is what the other three
                            points have been building up towards. Foreseeability: showing the player the choices they
                            have, desirability; what the player wants to do, connection; the players personal attachment
                            to that decision making, and finally the ability to actually make that choice and witness the
                            victories or failures that come from it. This ability of change is the most obvious component
                            of theoretical agency but the impact of it alone isn’t enough to make the players actions
                            foreseeable and desirable. (Thue, D., Bulitko, V., Spetch, M., Romanuik, T.,2010). In the
                            sandbox game: Minecraft (2011), the storyline is very loose, allowing the player to explore,
                            mine and create whatever they want, in whatever order they want. However, like all sandbox
                            games there are limitations, specifically Minecraft’s revolves around survival. These
                            limitations are normally designed to not overwhelm the player, whist also not being too
                            obvious and leading. This balance gives the player the perception of full control while only
                            having partial theoretical control along with limitations. Balancing these limitations, as linear
                            parts of a story, with the perception that the player is in control, by including non-linear
                            branching structures, with the use of player agency, you can create a fully immersive,
                            interactive experience which is unique to each player.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                            To conclude; the perception that the player is in control of a storyline by giving them
                            meaningful choices, illustrating a story which players can manipulate on an emotional level,
                            all while managing that control with limitations, that is the recipe for maximising player
                            agency. The very essence of player agency is how nonlinear structures can be balanced
                            with linear storylines to present a successful interactive story.
